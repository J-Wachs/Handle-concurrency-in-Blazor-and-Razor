<h1>Concurrency handling - demo</h1>

<p>This Blazor demo site shows how to implement optimistic concurrency control in your application.</p>
<p>This repo will be updated as the article series is published over time.</p>

<p>There are following parts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Customers Repository<br />The grid page calls the Customers repository class to get/maintain data. The repository uses the concurrency check build into EF
        Core and Microsoft SQL Server (Express works as well). The locking method is optimistic</li>
    <li>Customers API<br />The grid page calls a repository-client class that calls the Customers REST API to get/maintain data. The REST API calls the repository that uses the
        concurrency check build into EF Core. It is actually the same repository class as above. The code in the REST API show how to handle the concurrency stamp. The locking
        method is optimistic</li>
</ul>

<p>To see how the optimistic locking works, do the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Here in the Blazor demo, select one of the customer options in the menu to the left</li>
    <li>Create a customer. After creation, close the dialog. You are now back on the grid page</li>
    <li>Select the other browser, that shows the Razor demo</li>
    <li>In the Razor demo, select one of the Customer options</li>
    <li>When the grid is shown, click on the 'Update' button. The customer update page is shown. That it for now</li>
    <li>Select the browser showing this Blazor demo</li>
    <li>In the Blazor demo, click on the 'Update' button next to the customer</li>
    <li>When the customer update popup dialog is shown, change the name of the customer, and then click 'Update', and close the dialog</li>
    <li>In the grid, you will now see the updated name of the customer</li>
    <li>Select the browser showing the Razor demo</li>
    <li>It should still show the customer update page. Change the name here too. Click on the button 'Save'</li>
    <li>You will how see an error message, stating that someone else has changed this particiluar customer, after it has been read from the database</li>
    <li>This is the result of Optimistic locking. No data is overwritten</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note, that the two Customers grid pages are identical. The only two things changed are the '<span style="font-family: monospace;color: blueviolet">@@page</span>' tag
    and the key for the CustomersLogic service on the '[<span style="font-family: monospace; color: green">inject</span>]' attribute.
